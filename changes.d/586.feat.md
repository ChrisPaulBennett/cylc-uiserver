The UI Server is now configured to regularly ping active clients to ensure they
are alive. This helps the server to detect closed connections sooner, it also
ensures that open connections do not appear idle to proxy servers which are
sometimes configured to kill websockets after a period of inactivity.
You can override or modify this behaviour in your jupyter configuration using
the `websocket_ping_interval` and `websocket_ping_timeout` configurations, see
the Jupyter Server reference for more information.
